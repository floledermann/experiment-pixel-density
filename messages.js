`Welcome to this experiment!

In this experiment, we will ask you to perform some tasks at a series of stations, labeled "Station A" to "Station E". This is Station A.

At each station, please adjust the chair so that your chin rests on the rail in front of you, using the lever on the right hand side underneath the chair.

For providing feedback, please use the tablet in front of you. Please take this tablet with you as you move from station to station.

Press "Continue" on the tablet when you are ready.`

`For each task, you will be asked to push one of the buttons shown on the tablet. Try to respond as accurate as you can, <em>without moving your head closer to the display</em>.

If you do not know the correct answer, you are allowed to guess the answer or press a random button!

Press "Continue" on the tablet to continue the experiment.
